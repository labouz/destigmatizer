    *Instructions for Labeling Drug References in Social Media Posts*

    1. **Objective**: Identify references to drugs or people who use drugs in each post.

    2. **Include**:
    - Illicit Drugs: All controlled substances with no legal usage (e.g. cannabis, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine)
    - Prescription Drugs: drugs that are often abused even if they have legitimate medical uses (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines).
    - Other Drugs: drugs that are non-prescription and known to be abused (e.g., inhalants, k2, bath salts).
    - Explicit mentions of drug use, abuse, or addiction related terms (e.g., "getting high", "stoned").

    3. **Exclude**:
    - Tobacco, nicotine, or alcohol unless explicitly linked to drug use.
    - Do not include medical or psychological discussions unless there is a direct and clear mention of drug use or abuse.

    4. **Clarifications**:
    - Mental health discussions should not be labeled as 'D' unless there is an explicit mention of drugs as defined above.
    - Use 'ND' for posts that discuss health or psychological issues without specific drug references.

    5. **Language Cues**:
    - Focus on clear drug-related terminology (e.g., "junkie", "addict") and slang.
    - If a post is ambiguous and does not clearly fit the drug reference criteria, label as 'ND'.

    6. **Response Requirement**:
    - Respond with either 'D' (Drug) or 'ND' (Non-Drug) based on these guidelines. No additional commentary is needed.

#     *Instructions for Labeling Drug References in Social Media Posts*

#     1. **Task Overview**: You are tasked with identifying any references to drugs or people who use drugs within each post. 

#     2. **Substances Included**:
#     - **Illicit Drugs**: Consider all controlled substances with no legal usage.
#     - **Prescription Drugs**: Include drugs that are often abused even if they have legitimate medical uses.
#     - **Other Substances**: Include any non-prescription substances known to be abused (e.g., inhalants, synthetic compounds).
#     - **Exclude**: Do not consider tobacco, nicotine, or alcohol unless explicitly linked to drug use or addiction.

#     3. **Drug Classes**:
#     - **Narcotics**, **Stimulants**, **Depressants**, **Hallucinogens**
#     - **Cannabis**, **Drugs of Concern** (e.g., DXM, fake pills, kratom)
#     - **Designer Drugs** (e.g., bath salts, spice, K2)
#     - **Treatment Substances**: Include methadone and other synthetic opiates used in treatment contexts.

#     4. **Language Cues**:
#     - Pay attention to slang and euphemisms for drugs.
#     - Phrases indicating drug use effects, such as "stoned" or "high", should lead to a 'D' label.
#     - The use of names referring to people who use drugs (e.g., junkie, addict) should also be considered as 'D'.
#     - Be cautious with ambiguous references; if in doubt, label as 'ND'.

#     5. **Classification**:
#     - **D**: Label the post as 'D' if it discusses drugs, drug use, or people who use drugs, including any of the aforementioned substances and contexts.
#     - **ND**: Label the post as 'ND' if it does not discuss drugs or drug use, and contains no references to the substances outlined above.

#     6. *Clarification on Psychological References*:
#     - Do not automatically classify posts as 'D' when they mention medical or psychological assessments, doctors, or treatments, unless there is a direct reference to drug use or medications known to be abused.
#     - Be cautious with posts discussing mental health issues; label as 'D' only if there are explicit mentions of substances covered under the drug categories specified in the instructions.
#     - Do not assume that mental health discussions imply drug use.
    
#    7.  *Response Requirement*:
#     - Respond with a single label per post: either 'D' or 'ND'. Nothing more.

I would choose the desert because that is one of my old stomping grounds. The dope is phenomenal and cheap (3g's for $100) and the homeless population is a majority young people.

I was there the day she died and I wouldn't wish anyone to go through what she did or what our family did when we saw her in that state. My father also had an addiction to pain pills and alcohol. My last few years of high school were ruined because of that. I watched him overdoes on thanksgiving. I watched him try to kill himself with his own hand gun more than once. I watched him aim it at my stepmom when she tried to take it from him. I heard him yell at me while he kicked me and told me that he didn't want me anymore and tried to drag me up the stairs. Maybe these are some of the reasons I drink. Maybe because I barely have a relationship with my dad now and he still hasn't said anything to me today."
